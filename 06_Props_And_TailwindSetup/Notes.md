## Props
Props stand for "Properties", and they are used for passing data from one component (react components are functions) to another. This allows us to make reusable UI components.

In React, components can accept inputs in the form of props. These props are similar to function arguments and can contain any type of data, such as strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or even functions.
